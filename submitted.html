      <p class="section-text">Protecting the data that has been entrusted to you is an important and difficult task.  This task is exponentially more complex when your business maintains electronic health information.  Potential malicious entities, security oversight, or even neglect can trigger a breach event and cost your business significantly in direct fines and loss of revenue.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was passed by Congress in 1996 and outlines generally accepted standards for safeguarding your systems and data.  In 2009, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) expanded who falls under the HIPAA / HITECH auspices and greatly increased the potential penalties facing any organization that is not compliant.
      <p class="section-text"> HIPAA and HITECH standards can be overwhelming for an organization to properly implement and align.  We can help!  Piedmont Risk Mitigation provides HIPAA / HITECH compliance assessments and alignment.  We understand the complex requirements and can provide a path to compliance that simultaneously will protect your customer information and limit your potential breach and audit liability.
